# Eufy Security

Add support for Eufy Cam in Homey.
Based on: https://github.com/JanLoebel/eufy-node-client

Link: https://homey.app/nl-nl/app/com.eufylife.security/Eufy-Security/

# Account Information

Because of the way the Eufy Security private API works, an email/password combo cannot
work with _both_ the Eufy Security mobile app _and_ this library. It is recommended to
use the mobile app to create a secondary "guest" account with a separate email address
and use it with this library.

# Usage
- Install this app on your Homey.
- Go to the app settings and provide your Username and Password. Click Save Changes
- Other keys will be fetched and filled in to the settings page.
- Connect a device to Eufy Security
- Create a flow with Eufy Security devices

## Current features:
- turn on/off camera (EufyCam pan&tilt will turn its lens)
- Set guard mode (Home, Away, Disarmed, Schedule)
- Add devices and use them in flows. (on/off)
- Get notifications based on detection modes for specific devices. (Motion, Face, Sound and Doorbell Press) 
- Get images when motion is detected

## To do:
- [Feature Request] check if the keypad is going to work
- [Feature Request] Turn the eufy pan&tilt via Homey (e.g.: when youâ€™re home turn 180 degrees to the wall)
- [Feature Request] check if the motion sensor is going to work - IN TEST
- [Feature Request] filter devices when pairing - IN PROGRESS
- [Feature Request] Custom settings for security/guard mode - TO DO
- [Feature Request] Generic alarm for all cameras - IN TEST
